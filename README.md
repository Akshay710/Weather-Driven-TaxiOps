Utilize AWS for a scalable, cost-effective, and reliable infrastructure.
Ensure seamless data integration and storage.
Data Management:

Implement reusable methods for data extraction, cleaning, and preparation.
Create a robust Data Warehouse to integrate green taxi operations with real-time weather data.
Innovative Features:

Weather-Responsive Pricing: Implement dynamic pricing strategies that adjust fares based on weather conditions, maximizing revenue and optimizing service availability.
Scheduled Maintenance: Optimize maintenance schedules during low-usage periods influenced by weather conditions, ensuring maximum fleet availability.
Promotion of Pre-booking: Encourage pre-booked rides through discount incentives, shifting the demand from street hails to pre-bookings, and enhancing operational predictability.
Datasets:

Green taxi data from nyc.gov
Weather API data in API format
Project Objectives:

Consolidate performance monitoring through a unified system.
Enhance data integration and storage capabilities.
Improve business intelligence processes and decision-making.
